# ProcessingGames

This project is a nyan cat flappy bird knock off that was made in processing.
Processing is a branch of Java where you can make dynamic rendered code!
I made this project in one of my first programming classes.
The cool thing about this project was I had to transcribe
javascript into Java which was quite fun.
